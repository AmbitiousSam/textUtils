# TextUtils
TextUtils is a simple text editing tool built with React. It allows you to perform basic text editing tasks such as converting text to lowercase, uppercase, removing extra spaces, and counting the number of words and characters. Additionally, it also estimates the amount of time it would take to read the text.

## Installation
To install TextUtils, clone the repository and install the dependencies using npm:

```
git clone https://github.com/AmbitiousSam/TextUtils
cd TextUtils
npm install
```

## Usage
To use TextUtils, start the development server using npm:

> Note: Make sure to change the following line in the package.json file
```
    "start": "BROWSER=none react-scripts start" # This line will not open the browser when you run the application
    # If you do want to open browser when you run the application change this line to -
    "start": "react-scripts start", 
```
```
npm start
```
or
```
npm run start
```
 

To build and deploy TextUtils:
```
npm build
```
This will start the development server and open the application in your web browser. You can then start editing your text by pasting or typing it into the text area.
